# Chat App
A chat application created with express JS and Socket IO. 
Users can enter the chat room with an unique username thus enabling realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.
A new browser window needs to be open to establish a connection and add a new user.
The user can leave or disconnect from the chat room by closing the browser window.
